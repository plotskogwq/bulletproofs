# Ristretto Bulletproofs

A pure-Rust implementation of [Bulletproofs][bp_website] using [Ristretto][ristretto].

This crate contains both an implementation and a set of notes on how and why
Bulletproofs work.  The external documentation describes how to use this
crate's API, while the internal documentation contains the notes.
Unfortunately, `cargo doc` does not yet have support for custom HTML injection
and for documenting private members, so the documentation is built using:

```text
make doc           # Builds external documentation
make doc-internal  # Builds internal documentation
```

Unfortunately `cargo doc --open` rebuilds the docs without the custom
invocation, so it may be necessary to rerun `make`.

The description of how Bulletproofs work is found in the (internal) `notes` module.

## WARNING

This code is still research-quality.  It is not (yet) suitable for deployment.

## Tests

Run tests with `cargo test`.

## Features

The `yolocrypto` feature enables the `yolocrypto` feature in
`curve25519-dalek`, which enables the experimental AVX2 backend.  To use it for
Bulletproofs, the `target_cpu` must support AVX2:

```text
RUSTFLAGS="-C target_cpu=skylake" cargo bench --features "yolocrypto"
```

This crate uses [criterion.rs][criterion] for benchmarks.
